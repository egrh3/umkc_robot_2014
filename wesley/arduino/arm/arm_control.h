/* arduino/arm/arm_control.h
 *
 * provides the low-level access to the arm.
 * also contains some abstraction such as park, carry, and grasp.
 *
 * two functions of note are put_point and get_xyz.
 *    put_point, as written below is a translation using trig from
 *               an (x, y, z, pitch, roll) to arm angles. this allows
 *               ease of translation of the hand in the real world.
 *    get_xyz was designed to be the inverse of the above function,
 *            didn't return the same values.
 *
 *    both of these functions use an (x, y, z) co-oridinate frame
 *       set in millimeters.

		 * 
		 *      X - x1
		 *     --------  =  a known value, k when X is provided.
		 *     x2 - x1 
		 * 
		 *      we then solve for the unknown Y and Z by setting the appropriate
		 *      term in the above equality to k
		 * 
		 *      Y - y1
		 *     --------  =  k  -->   k(y2 - y1) = Y - y1  -->  k(y2 - y1) + y1 = Y
		 *     y2 - y1
		 * 
		 *      Z - z1
		 *     --------  =  k  -->   k(z2 - z1) = Z - z1  -->  k(z2 - z1) + z1 = Z
		 *     z2 - z1
		 *
		 *  when the guiding light changes, we just solve for the other two unknowns
		 *     in a similar matter.
		 *

		 *     point (X, Y, Z), where the guide is incremented by our quanta
		 *     of 1 mm (in the scale of the robot's reference frame)
